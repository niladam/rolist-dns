# rolist-dns

This file is just a list of DNSs to be blocked on my [pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole).

The list is based on [zoso](https://www.zoso.ro/rolist/)'s rolist.

If you want to use this list, you can add it in your ([pi-hole](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole)'s admin, under *Pi-Hole's Block Lists* like in the screenshot below, or manually edit your `/etc/pihole/adlists.default` file and add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niladam/rolist-dns/master/rolist-dns-clean.txt` to your custom list.
